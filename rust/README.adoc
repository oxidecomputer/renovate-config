= Rust configuration

== Automatic branch creation

By default, the Rust configuration does not automatically create branches (instead requiring users
to manually approve dependencies in the dependency dashboard).

To enable automatic branch creation, in your repository's `renovate.json`, extend from
`local>oxidecomputer/renovate-config//rust/autocreate` _after_ extending from the global preset.
This will enable:

- Automatic branch creation for dependencies
- Lockfile updates every Monday morning Pacific time

== Exclusions

The following crates are currently excluded from consideration:

- `vsss-rs`: Relatively delicate part of omicron (trust quorum), has shipped breakages in the past.
See https://github.com/oxidecomputer/renovate-config/issues/20[issue #20].

NOTE: If you're excluding a new crate, be sure to add information about it to this section,
including the reason(s) for exclusion.

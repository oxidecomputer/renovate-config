# renovate-config

Oxide's shared renovate configuration

## Global configuration

Any presets that you want to enable across all repos with renovate enabled in Oxide's GitHub organization can be added to `default.json`. Avoid putting any rules directly in default, instead using separate preset files for a cleaner configuration.

## More info

To learn more about how to include these shared config files in your own renovate setup see renovate's [preset hosting](https://docs.renovatebot.com/config-presets/#preset-hosting) documentation.
